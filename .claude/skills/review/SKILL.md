# Code Review

Perform a comprehensive code review following project standards.

## Process

1. **Get changes to review:**
   ```bash
   # For staged changes
   git diff --cached

   # For branch changes vs main
   git diff main..HEAD

   # For specific files
   git diff <file>
   ```

2. **Review against quality standards:**
   - Read `.ai/prompts/JAVA_CODE_QUALITY.md`
   - Check each category below

3. **Report findings with severity**

## Review Categories

### A. Code Quality

| Check | Look For |
|-------|----------|
| Method length | > 30 lines needs extraction |
| Complexity | Nested depth > 2, cyclomatic > 10 |
| Parameters | > 5 parameters needs object |
| Naming | Clear, descriptive, follows conventions |

### B. Modern Java

| Pattern | Correct | Incorrect |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Collections | `List.of()`, `.toList()` | `Arrays.asList()`, `new ArrayList<>()` loop |
| Streams | `.stream().filter().map()` | `for` loop with `if` and `add` |
| Optional | `.map().orElse()` | `.isPresent()` + `.get()` |
| Records | Used for simple data | Verbose class with boilerplate |
| Pattern match | `instanceof Type t` | `instanceof` + cast |

### C. Architecture

| Rule | Check |
|------|-------|
| Module boundaries | No API importing from Worker/EventConsumer |
| Persistence | Records/Documents not exposed outside service |
| Injection | Constructor injection, `private final` fields |
| Transactions | `@Transactional` on public methods only |

### D. Security

| Check | Look For |
|-------|----------|
| Injection | Parameterized queries, no string concat in SQL |
| Secrets | No hardcoded passwords, API keys, tokens |
| Validation | Input validation on DTOs, sanitization |
| Auth | Proper authorization checks |

### E. Testing

| Check | Requirement |
|-------|-------------|
| Coverage | New code has tests |
| Edge cases | Null handling, boundaries tested |
| Naming | Test names describe behavior |
